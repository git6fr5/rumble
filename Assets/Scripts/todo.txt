row 3: sign to world 1, world 2, world 3, world 4
row 4: dash, double jump, swim, wall climb

basic platform
moving platform
elevator platform
crumbling platform
bouncy platform
sinking platform
dissappearing platform A (dissappears and reappears on a timer)
dissapearing platform B (dissappears and reasppears in the opposite timing to dissapearing platform A)

row 2 & 3
spikes
basic star - resets actions
pivot cw - put in between a platform to make that platform rotate around this
pivot ccw - same as above but rotates counterclock wise

rows 4 -
timed traps (shoots something on a timerl)

people try to open up to them emotionally and unless its a main character they're ridiculed for feeling things



sinking and bouncy platforms are a bit weird

THERE NEEDS TO BE A BUFFER FOR THE INPUT ON THE BOUNCE PLATFORM
THE SINKING PLATFORM NEEDS TO NOT DO THE BOUNCY THING WHEN IT RISES UP
